# Smart Power Station
Smart Power Station is an approach for turning a power station unit into a programmable behind-the-meter energy storage system

A power station is an all-in-one combination of charge controller, battery, and inverter.

This project combines a power station with smart relays and an automated transfer switch.

It is intended to be paired with the Simple Demand Response project.

## Hardware

### Power Station

Bluetti power stations 

### Smart Relays

This project has been tested with Shelly smart relays.

Depending on the wifi network, a cheaper version of this project can be built with Kasa relays.

### Automated Transfer Switch

This project has been tested with 2 automated transfer switches.
